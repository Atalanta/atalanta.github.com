## What they say about us

> "Atalanta Systems consultants provided expert advice and a practical approach to the ongoing implementation of a scalable Drupal website. Their agile approach helped us to adapt our architecture requirements to cope with predictable levels of change while helping us remain flexible enough for dealing with extreme traffic spikes. I will not hesitate to use Atalanta Systems again for projects requiring expert, agile infrastructure consulting."

Branden Faulls, Development Manager, Capita National Strategies
  
  
> "We would recommend Atalanta Systems for any infrastructure project, and would be confident that the end result would be a well-designed, easy to manage environment, and a technical team better able to concentrate on core business."

Mike Mindel, Owner and CTO, Wordtracker
  
  
> "Intelligent, hard-working and foccussed. We have worked with Atalanta Systems for nearly 3 years. They have virtualised our front end, Java-based proposal system, ensuring the system has maximum redundancy. The system processes high volumes and so it is crucial the system is always running. They have also set up and managed our back end accounts systems, running on Solaris and Oracle. We are grateful for the in-depth technical knowledge they provide."

Andrew Barber, Programme Manager, eQuote and ICS, Private and Commercial Finance
  
  
> "The most overriding impression of Atalanta Systems is their "can do" attitude, backed up by a fantastic delivery track record. Coupled to their impressive technical credentials is a thorough understanding of key business drivers allied to true customer facing skills that allow us the opportunity to engage them directly with our customers without concern."
