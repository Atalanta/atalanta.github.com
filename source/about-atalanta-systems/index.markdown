## Agile Infrastructure Consultancy
test edit
If your core business depends on building and running software, you have two problems to solve, to stay competitive:

* How can you continue to innovate and get your ideas to market quickly?
* How can you ensure the services you provide or depend on remain reliable, perform well, and stay secure?

**Atalanta Systems** eases the pain of managing the infrastructure on which your business depends, so you can focus on activities that deliver value, increase profitability, and enhance your presence in the market.

We specialise in providing solutions to these challenges, by building automated infrastructures, often taking advantage of the flexibility of the cloud, and by applying agile and lean principles to IT operations.

We're experts at introducing a Devops approach to the software delivery lifecycle, and at building a mentality and culture inspired by the Lean Startup movement.

### Why work with us?
We have been leading the way in agile infrastructure development for nearly five years, and have a varied portfolio of large and small clients.

Our principal consultant and co-founder, Stephen Nelson-Smith, is internationally recognised as one of the foundational visionaries of the Devops movement, and a leading exponent of infrastructure-as-code, agile and lean methodologies, and cloud computing.

We have built strong relationships with leading service providers in the industry - people like Opscode and Amazon - and are well connected with prominent companies and individuals across the globe, people at the vanguard of the Devops movement.

Our consultants and engineers are all experienced Ruby and Python programmers in addition to Linux and Unix systems administrators, and are hand-picked for their creative and intelligent approach to problem solving.

We have decades of experience with open source software, and take a practical approach, often mixing in commercial tools and developing bespoke applications and toolchains for our clients.

We have a history of happy clients and a business built primarily on referrals; a clear sign that we're getting it right for a lot of people.

Contact us today to see how we can help your infrastructure bring value to your business.
